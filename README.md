# Kamiyomi
A Tachiyomi alternative for Linux

## Goals

To start, I simply want to make a simple update notifier. Right now this only works for 'Naruto', but I plan on expanding it.

Here are my long term objectives:
1. Have a viewable library that updates
2. (Possibly) Expand support to MangaDex as well as other sources
3. Create a functional terminal manga reader

## Libraries Used
As of now, I use the requests and bs4 python libraries for this function, although in the long term I wish to expand this to other websites.
